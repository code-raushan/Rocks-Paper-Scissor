# Rock, Paper and Scissor Game 
### Built using Vanilla JavaScriptðŸ˜Ž

It is a traditional game played by almost all of us in our childhood.

This time, play it in your mobile or desktop or PC with this [link](https://rpsgam.netlify.app).

The UI is created using **BootStrap**.

The game logic is fairly simple and extensive use of DOM techniques is done.(LOL!, it was mandatory thoughðŸ˜‚)
